# The Download Class
The Download class is the workhorse of the Download Manager. Its primary purpose is todownload a file and save that file's contents to disk. Each time a new download is addedto the Download Manager, a new Download object is instantiated to handle the download.The Download Manager has the ability to download multiple files at once. To achievethis, it's necessary for each of the simultaneous downloads to run independently. It's alsonecessary for each individual download to manage its own state so that it can be reflectedin the GUI. This is accomplished with the Download class.The entire code for Download is shown here. Notice that it extends Observable andimplements Runnable.
