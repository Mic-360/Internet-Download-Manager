# Internet-Download-Manager
Internet Download Manager in JAVA
The Download Manager uses a simple yet effective GUI interface built with Java's Swinglibraries. The use of Swing givesthe interface a crisp, modern look and feel.
The GUI maintains a list of downloads that are currently being managed. Each downloadin the list reports its URL, size of the file in bytes, progress as a percentage toward completion,and current status. The downloads can each be in one of the following different states:Downloading, Paused, Complete, Error, or Cancelled. The GUI also has controls for addingdownloads to the list and for changing the state of each download in the list. When a downloadin the list is selected, depending on its current state, it can be paused, resumed, cancelled,or removed from the list altogether.
The Download Manager is broken into a few classes for natural separation of functionalcomponents. These are the Download, DownloadsTableModel, ProgressRenderer, andDownloadManager classes, respectively. The DownloadManager class is responsible for theGUI interface and makes use of the DownloadsTableModel and ProgressRenderer classesfor displaying the current list of downloads. The Download class represents a "managed"download and is responsible for performing the actual downloading of a file. In the followingsections, we'll walk through each of these classes in detail, highlighting their inner workingsand explaining how they relate to each other.
